Welcome to the Netflix Dataset Analysis and Visualization project! This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing data from the Netflix dataset.
The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization of shows by year, type, genre, country, and ratings.

üìä Project Overview

Objective

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to gain insights and visualize different aspects of the data.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Clean and handle missing values in the dataset.

Visualizations:

1.Number of shows released each year
.
2.Distribution of shows by type (Movie or TV Show).

3.Top 10 most common genres.

4.Top 10 countries producing the most content.

5.Rating distribution.

6.Color palette visualization.

üìÇ Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

1.Pandas

2.NumPy

3.Matplotlib

4. Seaborn

üìú Files

analyze_netflix_data.py: Script for data preprocessing and visualization.

netflix_titles.csv: The Netflix dataset (ensure this file is available in your project directory).

üß© How It Works

Data Preprocessing:

1.Fills missing values in categorical and numeric columns.

2.Checks for and handles duplicate rows.

Visualizations:

1. Shows Released Each Year: Bar chart showing the number of shows released each year.

2.Distribution by Type: Bar chart displaying the count of Movies and TV Shows.

3.Top 10 Genres: Pie chart showing the most common genres.

4.Top 10 Countries: Bar chart illustrating the top countries producing the most content.

5.Rating Distribution: Bar chart displaying the distribution of ratings.

6.Color Palette: Visualization of a custom color palette used in the project.

üìù Example Outputs

1.Number of Shows Released Each Year: A bar chart showing the number of shows released annually.

2.Distribution of Show Types: A bar chart indicating the number of Movies versus TV Shows.

3.Top 10 Most Common Genres: A pie chart showcasing the distribution of the top genres.

4.Top 10 Countries Producing Most Content: A bar chart displaying the top countries.
